# Problem Sets

This is the repository for designing your weekly problem sets. Clone it to your desktop and keep it synchronized with GitHub for peer feedback and submissions.

## Before you Start

Edit the README.md file, add `2020-ps-MzCorona`.

# Instructions

To design a new problem set, follow the instructions below:

## Setup the problem set

Before you start designing your problem set for any given week, please complete the following steps. Make sure to do this every week with the appropriate branch name for the week (`week1`, `week2`, etc.):

1. Create a new branch called `weekX` (X=1,2,3,..., e.g. `week1`).
2. Create a new pull request from `weekX` back to the `master` branch. This is the pull request for peer feedback and it will stay open until you finalize your work, only merge once certain you want to submit your final version for grading.
3. Synchronize the repository with your desktop and make sure to switch to the new `weekX` branch for the new problem set (NOT `master` or a previous week's branch).
4. Copy one of the `blank_` template files to create a new notebook for this week's problem set (name it `weekX.ipynb`).
5. In README.md, remove all but one of the links from the `Binder link for peer reviewers` and `Binder link for final version` sections for the relevant week [below](#week-1).
6. Test-launch your binder for peer reviewers by clicking on the remaining binder link for this section (leave the tab open in the background, this may take quite a while because your binder server is built from scratch the first time - note: you can reload the page after ~1 hour if it's stuck).

## Draft the problem set

1. Design problem set draft by editing the problem set file (`weekX.ipynb`). If working in Jupyter, clear the output in the notebook **before** committing changes to git. There are two ways to do this: you can run the code block in the `cleanup.ipynb` notebook, or you can do this in your problem-set notebook by selecting Cell => All Output => Clear.
2. Make sure the binder link for peer reviewers below works for interacting with your draft problem set. Note that if you are using functionality from non-standard libraries other than `numpy`, `matplotlib`, and `pandas` in python, you may have to modify the binder configuration in the relevant `binder-` branch for your problem set to work on binder. If this is case, take a look at the [`BINDER.md`](BINDER.md) file and ask an instructor for help if you get stuck.
3. During next class, your peer reviewers will use the binder link below to interact with your draft problem set and will use the pull request to provide feedback.

## Complete problem set

1. Update problem set based on peer feedback. If working in Jupyter, run the code block in the `cleanup.ipynb` notebook, or clear output in your problem set notebook directly, **before** committing changes to git.
2. Create an answer key named `weekX_answers.ipynb` that provides example answers for all questions posed in problem set. If working in Jupyter, clear all output **before** committing changes to git.
3. Make sure the answer key runs completely without error in the binder for peer reviewers (should also work in final version).
4. Optional: ask peer reviewer to take another look before merging the pull request.
5. Once ready, merge pull request into master branch. Check that the binder link for the final version works.

# Week 1

#### Binder link for peer reviewers

> The link for peer reviewers. These only work once the `week1` branch exists.

#### Binder link for final version

> The link for instructor(s). This uses the `master` branch so will only have your newest notebook once you have merged your pull request for the week.
