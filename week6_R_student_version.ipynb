    "# Week 6, Introduction to Soil Moisture Storage with R\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### SETTING THE STAGE\n",
    "During the __week 3 lesson__ we learned that precipitation that falls to the ground may infiltrate the surface and flow downward through the unsaturated zone until eventually reaching the water table __(figure below).__ Extreme precipitation events can reach the water table very quickly, causing the water table to rise and usually recharging aquifers. \n",
    "\n",
    "More often than not however, water travels very slowly downward through the unsaturated zone. Depending on the local hydrogeology, _water can remain in the unsaturated zone for hundreds to tens of thousands of years_ before reaching the water table! \n",
    "\n",
    "In this week's lesson, we will learn about what water that is stored in the unsaturated zone is called and how it can change with time and precipitation patterns.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### LEARNING GOALS\n",
    "\n",
    "After doing this exercise, you should be able to:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Describe what can happen to pore spaces in the unsaturated zone during heavy rainfall vs. prolonged dry periods.\n",
    "- Define soil water storage.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Define the purpose of a `function` such that you can create your own.\n",
    "- Demonstrate plotting of four lines on a R plot. Oh my!\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### PREREQUISITES\n",
    "\n",
    "Before doing this exercise, you should know/review:\n",
    "\n",
    "Basic Hydrology\n",
    "- The difference between the unsaturated (vadose) zone and saturated zone.\n",
    "- The difference between varying soil textures such as clay, silt, loam, sand.\n",
    "- Water Year (WY), example: October 1st, 2000 - September 30th, 2001 represents WY2001. \n",
    "\n",
    "Beginner Programming Skills\n",
    "- How to comment and uncomment code for use.\n",
    "- Refreshing the kernel, running code from the top of the page.\n",
    "- Know how to access text and csv files for use.\n",
    "- Know how to plot one line.\n",

    "The unsaturated zone is an overlooked, but important reservoir for storing water. In the unsaturated zone, the open spaces between soil grains (see figure below) are occupied by water and air. The proportion of water and air in these soil pore spaces varies temporally, spatially and by the local soil type.\n",
    "\n",
    "After a large rain event, pore spaces in the unsaturated zone may rapidly filled with more water, thereby decreasing the air-filled pore spaces.\n",
    "\n",
    "During prolonged periods of dry conditions, more air may enter the pore spaces due to water in the soil being lost to soil evaporation and plant transpiration of deep roots.\n",
    "\n",
    "The amount of water stored in soil is dynamic: it can vary temporally and spatially in response to changes in climate, land-use and soil properties. Scientists studying this important reservoir refer to the amount of water stored in the soil as soil water storage (SWS). See the figure below."

    "The agricultural industry and irrigation managers use field equipment like soil moisture probes to monitor the soil water storage down to a meter depth. This is the preferred depth for monitoring changes as a result of root zone processes for agricultural production. Agricultural practices have greatly improved over the last few decades thanks in part to scientists studying the mechanisms that affect soil water storage.\n",
    "\n",
    "Subsurface hydrologists may also be interested in studying soil water storage, but the interest lies far deeper, ranging from several more meters to hundreds, depending on the depth to the water table. It is difficult to study soil water storage past the first meter of soil without digging expensive giant holes into the ground-- it is not cost-effective. For this and many other reasons, subsurface hydrologists employ computer subsurface flow models to study what soil water storage may look like at varying depths. \n",
