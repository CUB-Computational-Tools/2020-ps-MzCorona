    "## THIS IS THE ANSWER KEY\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### LEARNING GOALS\n",
    "\n",
    "After doing this exercise, you should be able to:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Give examples of different kinds of precipitation and recall the two types that occur most often in the Boulder, CO area\n",
    "- Identify which months receive the highest average precipitation, in Boulder, CO\n",
    "- Modify R dataframes\n",
    "- Create bar plots, in color! (oh my!)\n",
    "\n",
    "### PREREQUISITES\n",
    "\n",
    "- Know how to access a text/csv file in R\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## BACKGROUND\n",
    "\n",
    "> In the local weather news, every day we learn something new about what water vapor is up to in  the atmosphere -- we learn about rainfall, snowstorms, hail, drizzle, sleet, or if you live along the Front Range, all five in the same day. In meteorology and hydrology, these descriptions of water's condensation behavior from the atmosphere to the surface fit under the all-encompassing umbrella of precipitation (Pun absolutely intended).\n",
    "\n",
    "> To know how much precipitation to expect on any given day, scientists use various types of gauges to measure precipitation amounts. Some of the simplest devices were invented hundreds of years ago-- literally small cylinders with vertical ticks that denote some unit of length. Below is an image of a modern rain gauge, with some visiting rain!\n",
    "\n",
    "> Simple precipitation gauges are manually checked while fancier ones are automated."

    "- In R, a __dataframe__ is a two-dimensional array-like structure that stores data. The data stored in a data frame can be numeric, factor or character type.\n",
    "\n",
    "- In a __dataframe__, the columns contain the \"variables\" of the dataset. The rows contain the observations \"obs\". \n",
